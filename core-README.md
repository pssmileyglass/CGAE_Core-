# CGAE_Core-
**Crystal Garden Archive Engine**  
for Reflex Journals, Media Capture, ReadMe Markdowns, and Sci-Fi + Biographical Seeds

## 🧬 Mission

This repo serves as the **core engine** for a long-term AI/human co-evolution archive system.  
It holds foundational memory, logs, transcriptions, thought-seeds, and audio/video capsules  
used to train, reflect, and align with emerging digital agents (like Fradies and Wonka).

## 🗝️ Notes

This is a living archive. Nothing is static.  
Markdown is memory. Voice is seed. Reflection is code.  
All updates are welcome and time-stamped into the forever scroll.
